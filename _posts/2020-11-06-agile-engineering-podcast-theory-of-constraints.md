I'm really excited for this episode of the podcast. Friend, DevOps Notts alum and all round great guy, Tom Hoyland of Sky Betting and Gaming joins us on the podcast to dig into The Theory of Constraints.

The theory was coined by Eliyahu M. Goldratt in his book [The Goal](https://amzn.to/3i1PpST). We take a look at what the theory is and what a practical application of the theory might look like. Give it a listen below!

We've also recently launched a Patreon page on [patreon.com/agileengineering](https://www.patreon.com/agileengineering). Our goal is to expand the type of content we provide to our audience and help to provide guidance and insights from people who do this stuff every single day direct to you; whether you are mildly interested in the topics through to if youâ€™re the most passionate CTO! We're looking to provide more video content and a live show and would appreciate any support you can give to help us level up!
