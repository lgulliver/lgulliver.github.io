Jonathan, Pete and I continue our GitWatcher project. We pivot towards the new Static Web App preview as we look to build our UI with Blazor.

We had a couple of issues with what we were building this time around so we didn't get as far as we'd planned!

Check out the repository over on [GitHub](https://github.com/AzureishLive/gitwatcher)!

Don't forget, you can follow us over on our [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/azureishlive) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVQtNIXAgtJA-w9pd17WH5A) channels.
