This August, DevOps Notts celebrated it's first birthday and joining us to celebrate were Michael Gillett and DevOps Notts alum, Martin Woodward!

What was started as a conversation over a coffee and a doughnut in Nottingham has grown to something we never imagined it could. Attracting just over 1000 people over the last 12 months to come see and engage with industry leaders such as Gene Kim, Tom Hoyland, Manuel Pais, Martin Woodward, Devon Cockram and Louise Paling.

The last 12 months has been an absolute joy and we hope it continues for a very long time.
