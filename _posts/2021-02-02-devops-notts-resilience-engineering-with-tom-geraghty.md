In January, Mica and I had the privilege of hosting [Tom Geraghty](https://twitter.com/tom_geraghty) of [Red Hat Open Innovation Labs](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/consulting/open-innovation-labs) at [DevOps Notts](https://lgulliver.github.io/tags/#devops-notts).

We ran this event slightly differently to our usual format by having Tom as the only speaker and running things as more of a workshop than anything else!

You can catch the whole session on the video above.

Tom also provided a huge list of resources along with his slides which you can get over on the [DevOps Notts GitHub](https://github.com/devopsnotts/ResilienceEngineering).
