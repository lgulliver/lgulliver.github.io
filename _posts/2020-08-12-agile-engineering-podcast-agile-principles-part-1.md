This month's episode of the Agile Engineering Podcast is out now!

In our recent episodes, we've stripped back the tech, the frameworks and have focused on getting back to basics. In our latest episode, Jonathan, Mica, Louise, Pete and I take a look at the Agile Principles, specifically the first four:

1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.
3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.

We've also recently launched a Patreon page on [patreon.com/agileengineering](https://www.patreon.com/agileengineering). Our goal is to expand the type of content we provide to our audience and help to provide guidance and insights from people who do this stuff every single day direct to you; whether you are mildly interested in the topics through to if you’re the most passionate CTO! We're looking to provide more video content and a live show and would appreciate any support you can give to help us level up!
