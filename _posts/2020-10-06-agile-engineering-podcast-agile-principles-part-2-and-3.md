I am unbelievably behind on my blog post by a good month at this stage. With that in mind, I wanted to point out that both part 2 and part 3 of the exploration of the agile principles on the podcast are available now!

In part 2 we explore principles 5 through to 8:

5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.
8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

In the final part of the series, we explore principles 9 through 12:

9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
10. Simplicity–the art of maximizing the amount of work not done–is essential.
11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

Both resulted in some fantastic discussions so please go ahead and take a listen and feel free to input into the discussion here, on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AgileEngPodcast) or on our website, [https://www.agileengineeringpodcast.com](https://www.agileengineeringpodcast.com).

We've also recently launched a Patreon page on [patreon.com/agileengineering](https://www.patreon.com/agileengineering). Our goal is to expand the type of content we provide to our audience and help to provide guidance and insights from people who do this stuff every single day direct to you; whether you are mildly interested in the topics through to if you’re the most passionate CTO! We're looking to provide more video content and a live show and would appreciate any support you can give to help us level up!
