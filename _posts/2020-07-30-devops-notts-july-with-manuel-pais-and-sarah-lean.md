This month's DevOps Notts was a brilliant event. We were very lucky to have co-author of Team Topologies, Manuel Pais and Senior Cloud Advocate at Microsoft, Sarah Lean join us to talk about remote-first team interactions and hybrid Azure management with Azure Arc respectively.

**Manuel Pais - Co-author of Team Topologies - "Remote-first Team Interactions for Business and Technology Teams"**

Remote-first work is the "new normal" for companies around the world. There is no shortage of advice on how individual teams can bond and work effectively remotely.

However, there's not much out there on how to address remote interactions between different teams that need to collaborate remotely, as part of the same value stream. Moving from the physical to the online world can further expose pre-existing interaction problems, increase wait times and slow down delivery, and possibly response to incidents.

Based on the ideas from Team Topologies, Manuel Pais will present some useful approaches to clarify and evolve inter-team interactions and communication in this remote-first world.

Designing Team APIs and virtual communication channels that promote relevant team interactions while minimizing communication overhead will help modern organizations keep a fast flow of delivery once they're past the initial adaptation to teleworking.

Following well-defined interaction patterns and architecting for team-first software boundaries will also help reduce communication overhead, clarify expectations on teams, and increase visibility of on-going work and support.

**Sarah Lean - Cloud Advocate at Microsoft - "Hybrid Azure Management"**

Ensure your environments which could be spread across on prem infrastructure and Azure is managed in an efficient and effective manor. Join me in this session on how you can use things like Azure Policy, Azure Update Management, Azure Arc, Windows Admin Centre and many more tools to manage your hybrid environment.
